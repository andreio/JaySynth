# JaySynth

Simple JS audio synthetizer.
Uses AudioContext for audio stuff and AngularJS for UI.

#Components

##Oscillator

The main sound generator. "Type" determines the shape of the audio signal generated.

##Filter

It is used to cut frequencies out of the audio signal. "Type" determines the shape of the filter. "Frequency" determines at which frequency value the filter takes efect. "Q" determines the slope of the filter.

##LFO

It is a very fast oscillator which acts as a modulator for the main oscillator. "Frequency" determines the 'speed' of the LFO and "Gain" the strength of the effect.


#Output

Controls the output of JaySynth. "Volume" determines the final output of the synthetizer.

  
#Input
The synth can by played with a midi keyboard or the computer keyboard if "Virtual keyboard ON" is checked.
